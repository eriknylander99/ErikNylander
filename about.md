What is Erik and this site about?

***

Welcome to my website! This is a place for me to share the projects that I have been working on through my graduates degree in Data Analytics at the City University of New York's [School of Professional Studies](https://sps.cuny.edu/academics/graduate/master-science-data-analytics-ms). I will also be sharing other projects that I have been working on in my free time. A little bit about me... I earned my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics from Virginia Tech along with a Master's Degree in Curriculum and Education. I have a strong interest in R, Python, statistics, and mathematics communication guided, in part, from my work as a mathematics educator and Department Head over the last 15 years. Currently I am teaching at a small high school in Staunton Virginia, working with students taking college math classes while still in high school. My resume can be found on GitHub at [resume](Erik_Nylander_Resume.pdf)  

My interests include the use of data to inform education practices and identifying students that need extra support as early as possible. Also, given to coaching football for most of my career in education, I have a interest in the application of data science to collegiate an professional sports. I also have a strong interest in the application of open source platforms to data analysis including the Pandas framework for Python and R.   

I am the proud father of Jacob and Emma and husband to Patti who works in Natural Resources Management. This site was built using [R-Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) with markdown files and [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/blog/2289-publishing-with-github-pages-now-as-easy-as-1-2-3).
